## Comments

  * I tried to install a couple of other plugins (see branches), but ultimately I came back to the ones that you demoed in class - but I tried to make them my own; I hope that's okay.

  * I cannot tell you how grateful I am for the grace period for turning in assignments. I made a mistake by taking on full-time classes, full-time work, and then added purchasing our first house with an expedited closing to make things a little more challenging. I hope you can see from my work that I do care about this class and value you both as instructors. I'm really proud of this piece and I hope you enjoy it too.
