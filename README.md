## Resources

  * I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

## Deductions

  * I, *Jessica Marie Francis Arnieri Hernandez*, reviewed the list of deductions for this project and the syllabus.

## Comments

  * After I got to item 12 on the list, I realized that I had missed a lecture and that I had not actually added the jQuery file and associated link in any of the branches... so I went back and added it in toward the end of my work.

  * I did not realize that git takes capitalization into account in the branch names, and I accidentally created two separate jQuery branches, one with and one without a capital "Q". I know that I probably could have merged them at the end, but I was worried that I'd throw something else off in doing so.

* I'm sorry this one was so messy; I'm going to start over and redo the hw just for my own benefit - in the right order.
